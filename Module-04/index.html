              <p>
                The JavaScript console is integral to debugging our code. Understanding how to use it and what the strange message mean will help you become a better JavaScript programmer. There are no perfect programmers who never make an error. But there are super efficient ones who don't remain triggered by the error.
              </p>
              <p class='note'>
                The below code will output the error message correctly in Chrome and Firefox but doesn't seem to throw the appropriate error message in Safari. This is not a big deal as it only applies to this interactive IDE and not programs you run from your own scripts.

                <em>Uncaught ReferenceError:</em>
                tells you the category of the error. A reference error usually implies that you're attempting to
                <em>access a symbol (variable, function, array, object)</em>
                by the incorrect name. For example,
                <em>colour</em>
                is not the same as
                <em>color</em>
                so the interpreter would see that as a reference error.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, the
                <em>at 1:13 (m4p1.js)</em>
                tells you what file
                <em>(m4p1.js),</em>
                what line number
                <em>(1),</em>
                and what character
                <em>(13)</em>
                the character occured on. Because we're using an internal IDE I've labeled all the IDEs by module number and practice number. So this IDE is
                <em>m4p1.js.</em>

                The JavaScript command
                <em>debugger</em>
                allows you to place a
                <em>break point</em>
                in your code. The interpreter will stop at that point allowing you to evaluate your current code state. The debugger is a very handy tool for checking the value of a variable, the accuracy of a calculation, or the stability of a code block.

              <em>Objects,</em>
              like in most languages, are a way for us to encapsulate code under one idea. Generally an object is best described using a

                The statement
                <em>"Everything's an OBJECT in JavaScript"</em>
                is a misnomer.
                <em>MOST</em>
                things in JavaScript are objects. Or they're wrapped by an object if you attempt to use the access operator
                <em>"."</em>
                when accessing a property or method. That last bit is what confuses people into thinking that everything's an object. If a string isn't an object, then why can I call
                <em>"hello".length?</em>
                The reason you can access the property is because as soon as you use the
                <em>"."</em>
                the interpreter takes your string, instantiates a
                <em>new String() object</em>
                passing it as the argument to the constructor;
                <em>new String("hello");</em>
                which then returns a string object allowing you to call
                <em>"hello".length.</em>
                That's a lot of magic but helpful to you. The current primitives are
                <em>booleans, strings, numbers, null, and undefined.</em>
              </p>
              <small class='note'>Remember, primitives (booleans, strings, numbers, null, and undefined) are not objects but they can can be implicitly cast into an object if you attempt to access a property or method on them.</small>

                  These are the data objects. Each can be instantiated to create new objects, but they're not to be confused with classes in other languages. JavaScript objects exist immediately. They are not just a blueprint. This approach allows for dynamic property and method modification/creation during execution. For example, you can add new properties to the parent String() object. Those properties will then cascade to objects that have been created using the String object.

                The

                is instantiated when you open your browser. It contains all the functions and variables you create (at the global level, not using let or const). It also contains all the built-in browser JavaScript API objects and methods. In fact, there are over 900 properties on the window object. In fact, there are over 700 properties attached to the window object.

              Adding new
              <em>properties & methods</em>
              to an object
              <em>externally</em>
              is just as easy as modifying the original. Often we need to dynamically add new properties and methods based on an outside influence like a user or an API. We can do this quite easily by simply referencing the original object and then use the dot syntax (.) notation to create a brand new property with a value.

                  So far we have built very specific objects.
                  <em>person</em>
                  was an object that contained several defined properties, but was specific to only one person.

              <em>Object Constructors</em>
              are simply just a standard function. We can use these to create a
              <em>blueprint (just like classes do)</em>
              for what we want an object to look like -- any necessary
              <em>properties</em>
              it may need to contain.
              <br>
              <em>!!! REMEMBER: Properties in JavaScript can contain any value type INCLUDING function definitions. !!!</em>

              <p class='content'>
                In order for us to utilize object constructors we need to understand the concept of
                <em>this.</em>
                <em>this</em>
                is a powerful keyword in object oriented programming. In objects
                <strong>this</strong>
                represents the owner object, which in the case of an object constructor, would be the wrapping function.
              </p>
              <p class='content'>
                <em>REMEMBER:</em>
                MOST things in JavaScript are already objects. This includes<em>&nbsp;functions</em>.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class='col-sm-6'>
              <pre><code class='language-javascript'>// This is an object constructor. It is just a simple

function MyObjectConstructor (prop1, prop2, prop3) {
  // 'this' refers to MyObjectConstructor
  this.prop1 = prop1;
  this.prop2 = prop2;
  this.prop3 = prop3;

// Step 1: DRY up our person object by converting it into an object constructor
// a) Call the function 'Person'

// Step 2: Instantiate 2 new people using your constructor. Make sure their names are different

              <em>Above</em>
              we created a new
              <em>function</em>
              called
              <em>Person</em>
              with

              Once again, don't forget:
              <em>REMEMBER: Object Constructors are just simply functions. You can call this function. It's not really going to do anything because it doesn't have a return value, but you're not going to break anything if you call it.</em>
