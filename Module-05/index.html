              In programming, there 2 fundamental concepts of how data is passed around a program:
              <em>
              By Value
              </em>
              and
              <em>
              By Reference.
              </em>
              It is important to understand this concept as it helps you understand how prototypal inheritance works.

          <div>
            <p class='content'>
              <em>By value</em>
              means the value of what you're assigning is
              <em>copied</em>
              into a new address location. Everytime you assign x to another variable it will continually copy the value in the memory location into the new allocated memory location. Changing the original
              <em>x</em>
              will have no affect on any of the other values.

            <p class='note'>
              In the image above you can see we've set
              <em>x</em>
              and made the value equal to
              <em>5.</em>
              We've set
              <em>y</em>
              to be the value of
              <em>x.</em>
              As you will notice, the value is moved into a
              <em>new memory location</em>
              disconnecting it from
              <em>x</em>
              entirely. As you can see, logging
              <em>x</em>
              and
              <em>y</em>
              shows the values are completely different. This is because in JavaScript, values are
              <em>passed by value (copied)</em>
              and not by reference.

              As we keep saying
              <em>"Most things in JavaScript are objects".</em>
              Objects by their very nature are passed around by reference. This means that instead of creating a complete duplicate of the object only the
              <em>memory address of the object</em>
              is passed. So, when you attempt to access any properties or methods, you're always accessing the original. The largest benefit to that is that any modifications to the original will obviously be available to any of the references.

              In the image above we are creating a new variable,

              <em>object</em>
              with the property
              <em>a.</em>
              a has the value of 5. Next we create a new variable,
              <em>y</em>
              and we assign
              <em>x</em>
              to it. When we change the value of
              <em>x.a</em>
              it changes the value stored in the address location. Every variable currently referencing x has access to the property
              <em>a</em>

              and
              <em>pass by reference</em>
              will help you to better understand how inheritance works in JavaScript. Before we discussed how objects are immediately instantiated. Because of this, inheritance is a bit unique in JavaScript. There are 2 common ways inheritance is performed in JavaScript. We'll talk about the simplest method first, which is
              <em>inheritance</em>

              Last week we demonstrated
              <em>Object Constructors</em>
              and how we can use them to create a basic template for object creation, similar to how a class is used as a blueprint for object creation in other languages. However,
              <em>object literals</em>
              can be used to create a blueprint as well with a bit of out-of-the-box thinking.
            </p>
            <p class='content'>
              In order for our object template to be abstract enough, we need to consider all the pieces we will need. We should have an
              <em>initializer method</em>
              that will allow us to assign our object some values, similar to a constructor. The difference is we will have to call the method after the object is constructed. We will need some generic properties, but those should be defined and created using setter/getter methods to maintain normalization. Basically our object template should be a generic version of our final object:

              The above practice creates a very generic object called
              <em>Food.</em>
              Remembering what we had said about objects:
              <em>"Objects should encapsulate an idea. They can be correlated with nouns (person, place, or thing)."</em>
              Food is a thing and is a very generic category encompassing a huge collection of possibilities.
            </p>
            <p class='content'>
              Our property
              <em>type</em>
              will allow us to assign a type to our objects. There are quite a few possibilities for types. We could start more generic:
              <em>meat, vegetable, fruit, grain;</em>
              or type our objects by categories like
              <em>dessert, appetizer, or main.</em>
              Our options are endless, and with inheritance, we can start general and become more specific with each child object.

              <em>Object inheritance</em>
              can be likened to that of parent/child inheritance. We as children of our parents inherit traits from them. Our hair colour, eye colour, build, facial features, and even mannerisms are direct connections to our parents. However, we become more specific and unique versions by modifying these properties or acquiring new ones. In addition, we don't always tend to inherit from one parent; we inherit from both. In fact we inherit way up the ancestor line with bits of DNA passing down over centuries.

              <em>Object Constructors</em>
              are simply just a standard function. We can use these to create a
              <em>blueprint (just like classes do)</em>
              for what we want an object to look like -- any necessary
              <em>properties</em>
              it may need to contain. The one thing we haven't really discussed is what happens when we create an object using the object constructor method.
            </p>
            <p class='content'>
              The
              <em>new</em>
              keyword is what makes creating objects with object constructors doable.
              <em>new</em>
              does the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>It creates a new empty object</li>
              <li>
                It sets a new property on the object called
                <em>prototype</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                It binds all the properties set with the
                <em>this</em>
                keyword to the object
              </li>
              <li>It returns the newly created object</li>
            </ol>
            <p class='content'>
              So that's it, in a nutshell. Simply put, it translates our function into an object.

              property. Seeing as how
              <em>"Most things in JavaScript are objects!",</em>

              <em>object base.</em>
              The object base provides the other objects with a default set of properties such as a constructor, getter/setter for the __proto__ property, and a toString() method. Every object created inherits these from the object base.

              Sounds like a robot horror movie where the robot becomes sentient and murders all the harmless scientists! But it isn't.
              <em>Prototype</em>
              is a property automatically given to
              <em>functions.</em>
              When you define a new object constructor you can also define the properties and methods any children objects can inherit by adding them to the prototype bucket. Any properties defined inside the constructor are immediately added. External ones would have to be added by first accessing the prototype property then attaching the new property to it. In short, then, a
              <em>prototype is a property on a function that points to an object.</em>

              That's because unless the property is apart of the original object definition or attached to the prototype property it is private to the original object. You can use this feature to define private properties on the Person object that shouldn't be inherited by object created using Person or by new objects inheriting from Person.

              We can have one
              <em>object constructor</em>
              inherit from another object constructor. As discussed, an individual
              <em>Person</em>
              is likely to have more traits then afforded by the Person object. If we want to give it more traits using inheritance, we will need another
              <em>object constructor.</em>
              Why don't we create the
              <em>Superhero</em>

            <p class='note'>
              The call method basically allows you to call a function and then pass in a specific value for the
              <em>this keyword</em>

              <em>Multiple inheritance</em>
              isn't supported in every language, JavaScript being one of them. The idea of multiple inheritance is that an object can inherit properties from multiple objects at the same ancestry level. Unfortunately that is not the case as JavaScript requires chain inheritance where one object must be a child of another, but will pass the parent's properties as long as they haven't been overwritten. That is why many JavaScript programmers prefer to program with
              <em>composition over inheritance.</em>
              Composition, simply put, is creating an object that has the exact traits it requires. For example, a person can
              <em>move</em>
              and make noise by
              <em>talking,</em>
              however a dog can also
              <em>move</em>
              and make noise by
              <em>barking.</em>
              The implementation of noise is drastically different as the human has the ability to make millions of noises that form words and sounds where as the dog only has a few. So well both
              <em>human</em>
              and
              <em>dog</em>
              could inherit from a parent class like
              <em>mammal</em>
              the implementation would require both creatures to implement a different
              <em>noise method.</em>
              This is where
              <em>composition</em>
              makes more sense over inheritance.
            </p>
            <p class='content'>
              With
              <em>composition</em>
              we can create a trait called
              <em>talk</em>
              and a trait called
              <em>bark.</em>
              We can also create a trait called
              <em>walk.</em>
              The human will have the traits
              <em>talk</em>
              and
              <em>walk;</em>
              the dog will have the traits
              <em>bark</em>
              and
              <em>walk.</em>
              Our code would still be nicely encapsulated and modular, but we would be able to efficiently give each creature its specified properties.
            </p>
            <p class='content'>
              To sum up the difference:
              <em>Inheritance is when you design your types around what they are.</em>
              <em>Composition is when you design your types around what they do.</em>
